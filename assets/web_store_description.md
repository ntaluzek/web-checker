WEB CHECKER - STREAMLINE YOUR ROUTINE BROWSING

Tired of opening the same websites every day, one by one? Losing track of which sites you've already checked? Web Checker simplifies your routine internet browsing by helping you cycle through custom lists of websites efficiently and intentionally.

WHAT IS WEB CHECKER?

Web Checker is a browser extension designed with digital minimalism in mind. Instead of aimlessly wandering through bookmarks or trying to remember which sites you need to check, you create organized lists of URLs and navigate through them systematically. The extension tracks your progress, so you always know where you left off.

Think of it as a guided tour through your routine websites - helping you stay on track and avoid getting distracted or forgetting important sites.

============
KEY FEATURES
============

MULTIPLE URL LISTS
Create and manage as many lists as you need. Have one for morning news sites, another for your favorite webcomics, one for social media platforms, or lists for work-related resources. Each list is named and displayed in the extension popup for easy access.

BOOKMARK INTEGRATION
Already have your sites organized in bookmark folders? Web Checker can read your existing bookmark folders and turn them into URL lists automatically. No need to duplicate your organization - just select a bookmark folder and you're ready to go.

PROGRESS TRACKING
Web Checker remembers where you left off in each list. If you don't finish cycling through a list in one session, the extension will resume from the next unvisited URL when you come back. No more starting over from the beginning every time.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
Speed up your browsing with customizable keyboard shortcuts. By default, you can press Alt + Arrow Right to move to the next URL in your list, keeping your hands on the keyboard and your workflow efficient.

============
HOW IT WORKS
============

1. SETUP YOUR LISTS
Click the extension icon and go to Settings. Create your first list by either typing in URLs (one per line) or selecting a bookmark folder. Give the list a descriptive name like "Morning News" or "Daily Comics."

2. SAVE AND START
Click "Save Lists" to store your configuration. Return to the extension popup and you'll see buttons for each of your lists.

3. CYCLE THROUGH SITES
Click a list button to start. Web Checker opens a new tab with the first URL, and after the page loads, the floating navigation box appears. Click "Next" (or use your keyboard shortcut) to move through each site in order.

4. PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF
Close the tab or click the X in the floating box when you're done. Next time you start that list, Web Checker will resume from where you stopped, ensuring you see every site without duplicating effort.

WHY WEB CHECKER?
================

STAY FOCUSED
By following a predetermined list, you're less likely to get sidetracked or fall into browsing rabbit holes. You check what you intended to check, then move on.

SAVE TIME
No more trying to remember which sites you need to visit or hunting through bookmarks. Everything is organized and accessible with a single click.

NEVER MISS ANYTHING
Progress tracking ensures you won't accidentally skip sites or check the same ones twice. Complete coverage, every time.

BUILD BETTER HABITS
Routines and habits make life easier. Web Checker reinforces your browsing routines, making them more reliable and less mentally taxing.

DIGITAL MINIMALISM
This extension embraces intentional technology use. You curate what you want to see, follow your plan, and avoid the chaos of unstructured browsing.

==================
PRIVACY & SECURITY
==================

Your privacy matters. Web Checker is built with a privacy-first approach:

- NO DATA COLLECTION: The developer does not collect, access, or receive any of your data
- LOCAL STORAGE ONLY: All your URL lists and settings are stored locally in your browser
- NO EXTERNAL SERVERS: There are no backend servers, databases, or data transmission
- NO TRACKING: No analytics, no tracking pixels, no monitoring of your browsing
- NO THIRD PARTIES: Your data is never shared with or sold to anyone because nothing is collected in the first place.
- CHROME SYNC COMPATIBLE: Your lists sync across your devices via Chrome Sync (if enabled), but only within your own Google account

Everything you create in Web Checker stays entirely within your browser. The developer cannot see what lists you create, what websites you visit, or how you use the extension.
