# Web-Checker
Web Checker is a Chromium browser extension used to cycle through lists of websites that you like visit regularly.

## Summary
We are creatures of habits and routines and browsing the internet is no exception to this. With Web Checker we can simplify that process to make our browsing experience a little bit easier and perhaps be more intentional in how we spend our time online.

With Web Checker you establish lists of URLs that you wish to visit frequently and then it helps you navigate between them. Web Checker was designed with the concept of digital minimalism in mind. You curate the lists of websites you wish to visit and then navigate through them in the order you specified. This new way of going through your routine internet browsing should help streamline the process of checking in on the websites that you repeatedly visit and helps in preventing you from wandering too far off course.

## Usage

### Managing Lists
After installed, to get started with Web Checker you will want to access the extension (either through your browser's menu or by clicking on it's icon in your extension toolbar) and click on the Settings link. This will open up the Options page for the extension where you get to create your separate lists of URLs. Each list is given a name and you enter URLs, each on a new line, to form your list.

Use the "Add New List" button to create a new set of text inputs for you to create multiple URL lists. After you have made any changes on the Options page please be sure to click the "Save Lists" button to store your URL lists into your browser's memory. If you do not click save before leaving the Options page then any unsaved changes you made will be lost.

If you have a list that you no longer want and wish to remove it you can either replace the name and URLs with a new list or clear out both fields completely and save. Empty lists will not be kept saved in storage and will not show up in the extensions popup.

### Navigating Lists
After you have at least one list created and saved then it will become accessible from the extension's popup window. Again, you can access this through your browser's menu or by clicking on it's icon in your extension toolbar. For any lists you created, you will see a button with the name of your list. Clicking on that button will begin your navigation through the list.

When you start to go through one of your lists a new tab will be created and it will automatically load the next page in your list to be viewed. After the webpage has fully loaded and additional floating box will appear in the bottom right side of the page. This is a navigation box from Web Checker that displays the name of the list your are going through, a button for moving to the next URL in your list, and a progress tracker of how far along in your list you are. This box will stay floating above all other elements of the webpage you are visiting. Clicking on the "Next" button will bring you to the next page in your list and once you reach the end you will see it read as "Restart" instead.

In the floating box there is also a close button in the form of an x. If you decide that you no longer wish to have Web Checker present as you browse a webpage you can close out of it with this button and the floating box will no longer appear until you start up Web Checker again from the extension menu. Additionally, if you close out of the tab opened by Web Checker that will also end your session.

If you did not reach the end of your list before closing out of the Web Checker session then when you start again you will resume with the next page that you had not yet visited. This ensures that you get to go through your list in its entirety instead of having to restart back at the beginning every time.
